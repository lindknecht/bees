This code contains an implementation of the bee-algorithm.

It is based on and was used for the master's thesis "Schwarmintelligenz: Ein Bienenalgorithmus zur LÃ¶sung kombinatorischer Probleme" (Swarm intelligenz: A bee algorithm to solve combinatorical problems) of Nadia Thul at Fernuni-Hagen.

The main program is implemented in standard C. In addition, a simple user interface for Mac OS X is provided.
